# Python Data Analytics Project #1
This is a project where I analyze a dataset using Python. Throughout the notebook, there are visualizations, charts, and tables that answer various questions that are sprinkled throughout. The "Data Analytics for Restaurant Tips" file is where all of the Python code is while the other file is the original source for the data I worked with. I also added two machine learning sections, one where I build a machine learning model (regression specifically) for the total bill amount column and another for the tip column. To see the code in full, download the file and open it via VSCode as not all cells are shown on GitHub.
